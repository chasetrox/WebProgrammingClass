MBTA Assignment
===============
By: Chase Troxell, 8/2/16

This is the source for a web app built in Node.js/Express.js which draws a map of Boston's Red line and displays the closest station to the user. Within the gmaps-script.js file, I used the google maps API to plot the red line's stations and draw lines between each one. Additionally, upon clicking individual station markers, the app displays an infobox containing the next few trains predicted to arrive at that station.

I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone; however, I made
use of the Piazza forum, as well as StackOverflow for help.
