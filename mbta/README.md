I implemented the entire lab correctly; the index/stylesheet simply display the
map. Within the gmaps-script.js file, I used the google maps API to plot the
red line's stations and draw lines between each one.

This week, I implemented the user geolocation; javascript locates the user,
finds the closest MBTA station and displays it in an infobox/via a line to the
station. Additionally, upon clicking individual station markers, the app displays
an infobox containing the next few trains predicted to arrive at that station.

I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone; however, I made
use of the Piazza forum, as well as StackOverflow for help.

I spent roughly 6 hours on this assignment.
