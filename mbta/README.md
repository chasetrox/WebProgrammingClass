I implemented the entire lab correctly; the index/stylesheet simply display the
map. Within the gmaps-script.js file, I used the google maps API to plot the
red line's stations and draw lines between each one.

I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone; however, I made
use of the Piazza forum, as well as StackOverflow for help.

I spent roughly 2 hours on this assignment.
