I implemented the responsive.css file such that, upon resizing the page, a
different portion of the original image is displayed. The portion is determined
by the spec and is, as far as I know, correctly implemented.

I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone; however, I made
use of the Piazza forum, as well as StackOverflow for help understanding
media queries.

I spent roughly 1.5 hours on this assignment.
