I implemented the entire lab correctly; the JavaScript parses the JSON data
and updates the HTML to display the content of the messages.

I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone; however, I made
use of the Piazza forum, as well as StackOverflow for help.

I spent roughly 1 hour on this assignment.
