The contents of this repository represent my work from Tufts' CS20 course, or Web Programming.

The mbta subdirectories include the implementation for a web app in JS/Express which allows users to find which Red Line station is closest to them, as well as when the next train is coming to any Red Line station.

Further, in the mbta-server directory is an implementation of a JavaScript server which provides Red Line station info to the web app using Heroku.

The other subdirectories (Old kentucky, messages and responsive) contain simple HTML/CSS/JS homework assignments for CS20.
