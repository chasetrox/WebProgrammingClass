I implemented the entire lab correctly; I used an associative table with
hardcoded times and an event listener to change the lyric annotations at
specified times. Upon reaching these times, the HTML is updated to display
images/text to go along with the video.

I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone; however, I made
use of the Piazza forum, as well as StackOverflow for help.

I spent roughly 2 hours on this assignment.
